# Web-based Visual Query Designer

Web-based Visual Query Designer is a tool for visually generating SQL queries.
Currently, it is designed only for MySQL .

Feel free to try this tool for generating simple SELECT queries for the MySQL
database.

Think of it as a supplement to your MySQL front-end tool (like [
phpMyAdmin ](http://www.phpmyadmin.net/) ).

Why not try the [online demo](http://web-vqd.sourceforge.net/demo/) ?

Sourceforge.net project link (mirror): [ http://sourceforge.net/projects/web-vqd/

## Installation

Extract all the files to the `www` folder of your web server. Open `conn.php`
file and set the `$username` and `$password` for your MySQL database.

## Limitations (as of now)

  * A join can be made between 2 tables only on one set of condition 
  
  * Aggregate queries and sub-queries are not yet supported
